## 🧠 What Is the Pomodoro Technique?

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method that breaks work into intervals:  
Traditionally, **25 minutes of focused work** followed by a **5-minute break**.

This applet lets you apply that rhythm — or set your own — right from your keyboard.

## ⏱ Applet Behavior

- 🔵 **Blue breathe effect** when it's time to **focus**
- 🟢 **Green blinking** when it's time to **take a break**
- Automatically alternates between work and break periods
- Keeps time between polls — your cycle won't reset or drift

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Install this applet** in the Das Keyboard Q software
2. **Assign the applet to any key** on your keyboard
3. **Configure your own custom durations**
4. **Watch the key light up** based on whether it's time to work or time to take a break!
